Hi!

Thank you for your interest in reading about my work here in GitHub.

This page will be my portfolio and I will get back to it, fill it up and jazz it up as I go along through the courses I have. Despite having learned this stuff a while back, I have struggled to retain the information and I need to go back and do some of that again.

In the mean time, feel free to follow me on my socials and channels listed in my linktr.ee page.

Hope I see you soon. Ta ta!
